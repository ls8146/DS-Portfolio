## Introduction

In todayâ€™s competitive fast-food industry, understanding public sentiment is crucial for driving customer engagement and improving brand reputation. This report investigates the sentiment and emotions expressed in online discussions about two iconic fast-food chains: **Wendy's** and **McDonald's**. By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques and the NRC lexicon, we aim to uncover valuable insights into how these brands are perceived by their audiences.

### **Key Questions:**

1.  **Sentiment Comparison**: How do positive and negative sentiments differ between Wendy's and McDonald's?

2.  **Emotional Landscape**: What are the dominant emotions associated with each brand, and how do they vary?

3.  **Sentiment Trends**: How has sentiment for each brand evolved over time, and what factors might have influenced these trends?

The findings of this analysis will provide actionable insights to help these brands better understand their customers and optimize their marketing and public relations strategies.

## Data Collection

For this analysis, data was collected using **Google News RSS feeds**, capturing articles that specifically mention **"Wendy's"** and **"McDonald's"**. These articles provide unstructured textual data reflecting public discussions and opinions about each brand.

### **Processing Steps:**

1.  Articles were retrieved and stored in CSV files for analysis.

2.  The text data from titles and descriptions of the articles were combined to form a comprehensive text column for each brand.

3.  Sentiment and emotional context were analyzed using the **NRC lexicon** to categorize words into predefined sentiment and emotion classes.

This approach ensures that the analysis captures diverse and meaningful public discourse, offering an accurate view of brand perception over time.

```{r load-data}
#| include: FALSE 
# Load the datasets
wendys_news <- read_csv("https://myxavier-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/saylesl_xavier_edu/EUoBrIj5OFpLsJBDpqXZrNwBcaMa0dJ9ecxlLNJhWi42Hg?download=1")
mcdonalds_news <- read_csv("https://myxavier-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/saylesl_xavier_edu/EX4Xh8ewjE1JojZa464-BVIBS2zwX4DIt_juwczJX_IUOQ?download=1")

# Combine title and description into a single text column
wendys_news <- wendys_news %>%
  mutate(text = paste(title, description, sep = " "))

mcdonalds_news <- mcdonalds_news %>%
  mutate(text = paste(title, description, sep = " "))
```

## Question 1: Positive vs. Negative Sentiments

**Question:** Are discussions about Wendy's generally more positive or negative compared to McDonald's?

**Rationale:** This helps gauge overall public perception of each brand.

```{r sentiment-analysis}
#| echo: false
# Load NRC lexicon
nrc <- get_sentiments("nrc")

# Tokenize and join NRC lexicon
wendys_sentiment <- wendys_news %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  inner_join(nrc, by = "word", relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative")) %>%
  count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)

mcdonalds_sentiment <- mcdonalds_news %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  inner_join(nrc, by = "word", relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative")) %>%
  count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)

# Combine data for visualization
combined_sentiments <- rbind(
  data.frame(brand = "Wendy's", wendys_sentiment),
  data.frame(brand = "McDonald's", mcdonalds_sentiment)
)

# Visualize positive vs. negative sentiments
ggplot(combined_sentiments, aes(x = sentiment, y = n, fill = brand)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Positive vs Negative Sentiments",
       x = "Sentiment", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Key Observations:

-   Wendy's has a higher proportion of positive sentiments compared to McDonald's.

-   Wendy's exhibits a slightly higher share of negative sentiments, highlighting areas for improvement.
