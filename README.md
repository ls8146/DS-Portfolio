## Projects and Experiences

### 2024 Data Science Summer Internship

Hired as a one-month Intern for Xavier University with the assignment of improving Xavier’s Core curriculum. In a 
team, we built models and provided insights on the most problematic sections of the core curriculum for all Xavier 
students and recommendations for improvement based on the data. Through analytical and statistical skills, we 
provided powerful insights that were used by the university’s review board to improve the student’s core 
experience.  

### Court of Common Pleas Campaign Analyst

As part of our Data Science Degree, we participated in the election for 2024 as campaign analysts. Through this role 
we provided insights that allowed candidates to determine where to focus their efforts to ensure the greatest 
impact of their campaigning efforts. We created models such as a map of swing voters, early voting predictions, 
turnout predictions and voter lists that help candidates target their voter groups, allowing for our assigned 
candidate to win their race.

In this project, I was assigned to perform web-scraping on any website of my choosing and then use that data to create useful insights. 


[API Data Retrieval](https://rpubs.com/saylesl/OMDb) 

In this Project, I was tasked with using an API to gather information that could be used for analysis.


[Text Data Retrieval and Analysis](https://rpubs.com/saylesl/1253997)

In this project, I was tasked with using an API to retrieve information that can be used for Text Analysis. I then performed a text and sentiment analysis on the data retrieved.
